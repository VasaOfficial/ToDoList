A simple Todo project in witch I added form for user to input and store info and then see it saved in inbox section.
Even tho this project has function to store info it isn't a real storage.
I improved my knowledge of modules (This one I learned about date module for manipulating time in js) and I implemented and learned more about factory functions.
There is definitly room for improvment in this project but for now I'm moving on.
